# Mineral-Classification-Using-Transfer-Learning-with-FastAI

With the Help of Transfer Learning with Resnet50, the model for Classifying 3 different Classes of minerals (Olivine, Actinolite, Epidote ) with an Accuracy of 84%.
# The Dataset is Attached, It was obtained from Pinterest where each of the categories contains the exactly 250 images
You can play around with the dataset as it is a bit noisy

#"strin".pkl is the trained model with Resnet50 wieghts

If you are a fastai user then you can directly load them with .load_learner('"string".pkl')

# Finally the .ipynb file

It contains how I got the result with fastai library. You can take it as a reference
